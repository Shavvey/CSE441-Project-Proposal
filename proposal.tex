\section*{Introduction and Outline of Project}
Hashing, as an overall process, is a function that maps
plaintext data of any length into a fixed-length ciphertext
output--often called a digest. Hash functions, unlike encryption,
destroy information encoded in the plaintext, which means
the function is one-way and cannot be reversed to obtain
the plaintext again.
Hash functions are a widely used cryptographic algorithm.
They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as
data integrity verification, password storage, and digital
fingerprint/signatures, and data indexing (often called hash-tables).
Since hash functions serve vital purposes in modern cryptography
and computer science, knowing the important mathematical properties
of a hash function (and how these can be implemented in programs)
is critical to understanding their function. Once the function and
real-world implementation
